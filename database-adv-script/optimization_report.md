After improving the query by:
- Selecting only the columns that were needed
- Adding indexes on important fields

The execution time improved to **0.189 ms** and the planning time dropped to **0.935 ms**.

These changes made the query faster by reducing how much data it had to handle and helping the database find information more quickly.

### Summary

The updated query runs better and is more efficient than the original version.
